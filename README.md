## Techs:
The application was built with **vite**, from a **react-ts** template. Strategies used:
- **Styled Components** for styling;
- **Typescript** in data typing;
- **phosphor-react** for availability of icons;
- **date-fns** for date comparison;
- **react-router-dom** for page routing;
- **react-hook-form** for form handling;
- **zod** for form validations;
- **ContextAPI** for global state handling;
- **LocalStorage** for data persistence after page reload.
